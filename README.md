# Impacts on Society

Describe your course including the name, description, and grade level. Broadly explain how this document details how you plan to incorporate issues of computing impacts on society in your course

One week dive into phone apps.  Could be scaffolded for grades 7-8 through high school.  Could be used in many courses, computer science, mental/behavioral health, general science

CER about postive/negative impacts of phone apps

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

Describe the learning objectives for the class that relate to social impacts. Consider using Bloom's Taxonomy to identify the types of cognitive and/or affective outcomes (and their associated verbs): https://bloomstaxonomy.net/

The students will evaluated and synthesize various texts and videos in order to write a claim, based on evidence and backed with reasoning to answer the question, "did the app revolution have a more postive or negative social impact? 

The students will generate a claim, based on evidence and backed with reasoning, in order to write an essay.

The students will determine how evidence supports a claim and what reasoning supports this evidence.

### Learning Activities

Describe the learning activities and how they will be incorporated into the class. For example, will they include class discussion, written reports, homework, or exams? Will the activity be a one-time lesson or used multiple times in class?

One week in length; texts, videos, etc introduced and disected/discussed daily as evidence is gathered 
gather evidence from videos, articles, studies, charts, etc 
complete gathering evidence chart as students go over information; evaulate each piece of evidence and determine if in support of + impact or - impact and discuss reasoning
discuss counterclaim and counter evidence
identify top 3 evidence/reasoning combos and complete graphic organizer/outline of essay; include at least one rebuttal of counterclaim (can be added/ommitted for grade level/ability level

will attach student documents, links to videos, articles, etc.

develop day by day plan, can take from one to two weeks, depending on class time, grade level, depth of discussion


### Assessment

Describe how you plan to assess the learning objectives described above.

assess learning based on rubric for written essay(have one in mind, will attach); teacher observation of class discussions

### Outcomes

Describe how your plan will facilitate diversity/equity/inclusion and help broadening participation in computing. Also describe how the course plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society.

the goal would be to open students minds to the idea that computing can be a great tool, but also can be a detrement if abused.  It would hopefully get students to think about the amount of time they spend on apps, and evaluate apps for thier "usefulness" on a different scale.  As a teacher, the downside to apps is literally in my face all day every day.  Students have difficulty focusing for the length of time it takes to complete an upper level math problem.  I battle with the distraction of their apps and fear for the future of society if the next generation is so addicted that they can't put down their phones long enough to be successful, contributing members of society.  However, I love technology and want to teach them how to balance their use of it so that the impacts on society can be mostly positive.
