# Impacts on Society

The course, Intro to Computer Science, will introduce you to the field of computer science and the fundamentals of computing. This course is specifically designed for students with no prior experience, and will teach students about the basics of computing.  Students will be exposed to hardware components and their tasks.  The course will cover the Google Suite of software and will introduce students to basic coding and creating mini games.

We will complete a one week dive into phone apps.  This assignment could be scaffolded for grades 7-8 through high school and would be appropriate for many courses,such as computer science, mental/behavioral health,  and general science.  The following is an outline of the weekly plan with website links and worksheets

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

* The students will evaluate and synthesize text in various forms in order to write a claim, based on evidence and backed with reasoning to answer the question, "does the daily use of apps have an overall more positive or negative social impact?” 

* The students will generate a claim, based on evidence and backed with reasoning, in order to write an essay.

* The students will determine how evidence supports a claim and what reasoning supports this evidence.

### Learning Activities

Describe the learning activities and how they will be incorporated into the class. For example, will they include class discussion, written reports, homework, or exams? Will the activity be a one-time lesson or used multiple times in class?

This mini unit will be one week in length.  Various texts are introduced, dissected, and discussed daily as evidence is gathered using the Gathering Evidence Sheet.  The sheet is used to take notes for later reference.  Students will ultimately have to develop a claim and use this evidence to support that claim.

### Day 1

#### Materials

* Sheet of paper and a pencil

* Think-Pair-Share Strategy

* Polling tool or website, such as Poll Everywhere, with the prompt in a poll ready to be answered

* Website : App Usage Statistics - https://techjury.net/blog/app-usage-statistics/

#### Outline

* Introduce the prompt: Does the daily use of apps have an overall positive or negative social impact?

* Head the sheet of paper with “day 1”

* Give the students 5 minutes to write down what they think at the moment.

* After the students have written their thoughts down, have them discuss with their neighbors for 2 minutes

* Show the Poll Everywhere site and code and have students vote whether they think apps have a more positive or negative impact; discuss the results

* Give access to the link https://techjury.net/blog/app-usage-statistics/ or printed out materials from the site.  Have students explore the data for 15-20 minutes and write down two things they notice and two things they wonder on their sheet of paper.  Sentence stems can be given if needed: I noticed…, I wonder…

* As an exit ticket, have the students choose one of their four notice/wonder statements to write on a stickey note.  Put these on a larger piece of paper or a section of the board for later reference

### Day Two

#### Materials

* Sheet of paper from yesterday and a pencil

* A few of yesterday’s exit tickets with “notice” sentence

* Gathering Evidence Chart

* Websites : App Usage Statistics - https://techjury.net/blog/app-usage-statistics/; 
Mobile App Industry Statistics - https://www.zippia.com/advice/mobile-app-industry-statistics/;
Pew Research Center - https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/03/07/majorities-say-mobile-phones-are-good-for-society-even-amid-concerns-about-their-impact-on-children/pi_2019-03-07_global-mobile_-2-02/ 

#### Outline

* Have students draw a line under their notes from yesterday on their sheet of paper, and write Day two below it.  Remind them this is their place to jot down notes that are not necessarily evidence.  Thoughts they have, notices, wonders, etc., can go on this sheet

* Begin by sharing some of the exit tickets from yesterday with notice statements and lead a discussion around these statements.  Have the website from yesterday available to see again, it is ok if students come up with new things they notice.

* Introduce the Gathering Evidence Sheet and show how to use it with text from the first website.  The “source” column is the place to put the name of the article and source.  The evidence should be information directly from the source, and the reasoning shows how the evidence supports the claim.  As you gather evidence, you should find pieces of evidence that support both a positive impact and a negative impact.  Students will be deciding which side they support and generating their claim from the gathered evidence.  Model choosing a piece of evidence and discuss the reasoning, then have students help find another piece of evidence and discuss the reasoning.

* Introduce the next website and work as a class to identify pieces of evidence that could be used to support a claim.  These discussions are important as sound reasoning can be harder to develop.

* As an exit ticket, on their sheet of paper, have students complete the sentence stem, “So far I think…, because…” This is the first time they will decide if they are leaning towards a positive or negative impact.  They should put names on the back of these sticky notes.  Collect them as the students leave the class.

### Day Three

#### Materials

* Same sheet of paper, and pencil

* Gathering Evidence Chart

* Websites: Wired UK - https://www.wired.co.uk/article/the-apps-that-benefit-society  ;
Student Newspaper - https://portagenorthernlight.com/4438/opinion/apps-helpful-or-a-waste-of-time/ ;

Student Newspaper - https://lshsvalhalla.com/opinion/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-of-apps-on-our-phones/ 

#### Outline

* Have students draw a line under their notes from yesterday on their sheet of paper, and write Day Three below it.  Remind them this is their place to jot down notes that are not necessarily evidence.  Thoughts they have, notices, wonders, etc., can go on this sheet

* Begin by sharing some of the exit tickets from yesterday.  Have students read their statements and then allow 30 seconds of silence for everyone to consider that statement.  Students can write down things they agree or disagree with on their sheet of paper.  

* Depending on the ability level of your class, you could either continue whole class dissection and discussion, completing the Gathering Evidence chart as a whole; or you can let students gather evidence on their own.  Teams and small groups work as well.   Of course, you can always do a mixture of this by having students analyze an item and share a potential piece of evidence for everyone to put on their charts.  It is really up to the individual teacher to decide the best way to proceed with the students.

* This 3rd day is a heavy data collecting day and the majority of time should be spent analyzing text and gathering evidence.

* The same exit ticket from yesterday, with a twist, can be used.  Students will complete one of two statements: 1) I used to think…but now I think…because… (giving a piece of evidence that helped change their mind) or 2) I still believe…because…(giving a new piece of evidence that helps them keep their original position)

### Day Four - 
This would be the day you decide to either begin drafting the paper with a graphic organizer or to continue gathering evidence depending on how long your class needs for evidence gathering. You can have students continue analyzing text for the next two days and have students complete the writing portion the second week, or you can have students draft today and complete the final paper tomorrow.

#### Materials

* Same sheet of paper, and pencil

* Gathering Evidence Chart

* Graphic Organizer for draft outlining

* Chart Paper

* Rubric For Grading

#### Outline

* Have students draw a line under their notes from yesterday on their sheet of paper, and write Day Four below it.  Remind them this is their place to jot down notes that are not necessarily evidence.  Thoughts they have, notices, wonders, etc., can go on this sheet.  Today, they will be deciding which side they think the evidence supports and drafting their claim.

* All students will have the same “skeleton” of a claim, the only difference will be if they choose positive or negative impact.  The students will begin by reviewing the evidence they have gathered for 10-15 minutes.  At the end of that time, they will have one of two claims; 1) The daily use of apps has an overall positive social impact; or 2) The daily use of apps has an overall negative social impact.

* After students have their claim, send the positive impact students to one side of the room with their note sheet and evidence chart, and the negative impact students to the opposite side.  They will be given 15 minutes to change someone’s mind with their evidence.  One student speaks at a time from each side, and a volley of evidence and reasons occurs.  Students can change sides at any time.  By the end, they should be solid in their view.  This can be harder for younger students as they sometimes can be easily swayed.

* Once they are decided on their side 100%, break them into groups of four, positives with positives and negatives with negatives.  Give them the poster paper and graphic organizer and explain how to complete each.  They should duplicate the graphic organizer onto the poster and add the agreed upon evidence and reasoning to it.

* They will be choosing 3 pieces of evidence and the corresponding reasoning to use in their paper to put into the graphic organizer.  Student teams need to agree on the three that go on the group paper, but individuals may deviate from the group when completing their graphic organizer and paper.  Give about 20-30 minutes for this activity and make sure to be checking in on groups so they are progressing.

* Hang the finished posters around the room and allow students to view them as needed.  The students are entering the individual portion of the assignment at this point. 

* Introduce the rubric, read through it as a class and answer any questions.

* Students should complete their own graphic organizer and then write the rough draft of their Claim, Evidence, Reasoning Essay on their own.  They can use information from their evidence chart or from any poster around the room.

* You can choose to edit the papers for your students or use a peer editing system.  Students should show you their edited draft before beginning their final paper.

### Day Five

#### Materials

* Same sheet of paper, and pencil

* Gathering Evidence Chart

* Graphic Organizer for draft outlining

* Chart Paper Posters

* Edited Rough Draft

* Chromebook/laptop or lined paper and pen

#### Outline

* Today the students should be finishing up their edits and getting teacher approval to type or write their final draft.

* Make sure students are progressing through their rough and final draft

* Give directions on how to turn in the final draft: on paper, through Google Classroom, email, or sharing; depending on your preference

### Assessment

The students will be given daily participation points as assessed by teacher observation.  The final draft will be graded on a rubric that will be discussed with students so they know exactly what is expected of them. Students will be able to rewrite for a better score after conferencing with the teacher if they choose to do so.

### Outcomes

The goal would be to open students' minds to the idea that computing can be a great tool, but also can be a detriment if abused.  It would hopefully get students to think about the amount of time they spend on apps, and evaluate apps for their "usefulness" on a different scale.  

As a teacher, the downside to apps is literally in my face all day every day.  Students have difficulty focusing for the length of time it takes to complete an upper level math problem.  I battle with the distraction of their apps and fear for the future of society if the next generation is so addicted that they can't put down their phones long enough to be successful, contributing members of society.  However, I love technology and want to teach them how to balance their use of it so that the impacts on society can be mostly positive.
